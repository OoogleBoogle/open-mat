# Project Open Mat


Open mat is an app that allows you to find gyms nearby that offer open mats. It will take your geolocation and find stored gyms via MongoDB geospatial query.

## To do:

1. Create basic frontend using react and redux.
2. Use geolocation to get users position for api request to display nearby gyms and their open mat availability.
3. Possible Extras: Search by city, name, type, time. Sorting. User authentication. Reviews.
